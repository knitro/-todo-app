## What is it?

MyToDo is a ToDo multi-platform app originally designed and developed for my own personal needs. It has features and flows that I feel help plan out your tasks and goals that you want to accomplish, while also making it clear on what needs to be done first, and when.

## Feature List

- Multi-platform! You can access your tasks on any platform (PC/Web, Android, IOS)
- Daily Tasks
  - A separate section for the tasks that you know you need to get done today when you get home.
- Task Dependency
  - Often, tasks are dependant on another task or action happening. You are able to create these dependencies, so you can see what tasks are the most important to get done to avoid you getting blocked.

## Technology Stack

- React w/ Typescript
- Ionic Framework
- Google Cloud (Google Firebase)
